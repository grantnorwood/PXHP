  | PXHP is a PHP-only library for building and rendering UI widgets,    |
  | but without the XML stuff that XHP uses.  This makes it easier to    |
  | install and use without building/making/installing any extensions,   |
  | even in shared hosting environments.  Also, XHP isn't available on   |
  | Mac or PC quite yet, so this will have to do for those of us who     |
  | don't do all of our development in a Linux environment.  Facebook    |
  | did an amazing job with XHP, it's just not currently available       |
  | to everybody!                                                        |

  | The PXHP project is based on the open-source XHP project by          |
  | Facebook, located at https://github.com/facebook/xhp.                |
  |                                                                      |
